- Over time, it has gone through different versions, each bringing new features and improvements for web designers and developers.

* CSS1 (1996) :
- The first version of CSS introduced basic styling features like text formatting, lists, margins, borders, color, and backgrounds.
- It worked in most browsers, but older browsers had some issues with lesser-used features like spacing and display settings.

* CSS2 :
- This version focused on layout positioning and media types, such as styles for printing.
- However, certain features like aural style sheets (for sound) were never widely adopted and were eventually removed.

* CSS2.1 (2004) :
- This was an update to CSS2 that fixed issues and clarified rules but didn't bring any big new changes.

* CSS3 :
- Unlike earlier versions, CSS3 is a collection of smaller modules released independently.
- It introduced powerful new features like advanced selectors(for targeting elements), gradients(for color transitions), shadows, animations, transitions, and much more.
- Modules include Selectors, Box Model, Backgrounds, Borders, Text Effects, and Transforms.
