# Element & Tag in HTML :

Question) - What is a tag?
Answer) -
- HTML uses a system of "tags" to define the structure and layout of web pages.
- Tags are the building blocks of HTML documents and consists of angle brackets enclosing specific keywords.
- Tags provide instructions to web browsers on how to display the content.
- An HTML tag is composed of an opening tag and, in some cases, a closing tag. The opening tag starts with the less-than symbol (<), followed by the tag-name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The closing tag is similar, but it also includes a forward slash (/) before the tag-name.

* For example :

------------------------------

* Opening Tag : <tagname>
* Closing Tag : </tagname>

# Types of HTML Tags :

# HTML Tags can be broadly categorized into two types :

1. Paired Tags(or Container Tags) :

- Paired tags have both an opening and a closing tag and can contain other HTML elements and text within them.
- They define a specific section or structure in the web page.

* Some common paired tags include :
- Some common examples are <html>, <head>, <p>, <span>, etc.

2. Singular Tags(or Void Tags) :

- In HTML, some are self-closing tags or void tags because they don't require a separate closing tag.
- These tags are used for elements that don't contain any content or don't have a closing counterpart.

* Example : <img />, <input />, <br />, and <meta />, etc.


Question) - What is an Element?
Answer) -
- HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document.
- HTML elements consists of a start tag, an end tag(if applicable), and content in between the tags. The start defines the beginning of an HTML element, and the end tag defines the end of an HTML element.

# Anatomy of an HTML Element :

* Each HTML element has a specific structure that defines its behavior and appearance on a web page.

* Here is a breakdown of the anatomy of an HTML element :

1. Opening Tag :
- This is the opening tag that defines the beginning of an HTML element. It is enclosed in angle brackets (<>).

2. Content :
- This is the text or other data that appears between the start and end tags of an HTML element.
- Some HTML elements do not require content and are self-closing.

3. Closing Tag :
- This is the closing tag that define the end of an HTML element.
- It is enclosed in angle brackets with a forward slash (/) before the element name.
